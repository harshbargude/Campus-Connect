# Campus-Connect
A Web app for a college/university. This web app is used to report incident to respective management, so to fix the issue in college environment


hi coders,

What I learn while building this project:
  in this project I was handling backend and the admin page in our team.
  ⭐I learn obout how a database works behind, how the connection has to build for data operation,
  how an html form and their fields are connected to back-end.
  ⭐The sign n page logic...like when the user will get to in after varification their emain and respective password.


notice if you are using this code:
  ⭐first of you should design your own database
  ⭐change all your database details with my, and you are good to go.
